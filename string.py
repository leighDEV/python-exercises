# 1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.

# 2. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string

# 3. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from
# a given a string. If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the empty string.

# 4. Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of
# its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.

# 5. Write a Python program to get a single string from two given strings,
# separated by a space and swap the first two characters of each string.

# 6. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3).
# If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the
# given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.

# 8. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and return the longest word and the length of the longest one.
